        <h2 id="perception-head">Perceptions</h2>
        <p id="perceptions-paragraph-1">
            We as humans have formed many different views of the world. These views usually determine how we behave and react to different situations. 
            These views can also shape the way an individual leads and sees leadership. People tend to trust older individuals to lead more due to the
             amount of experience and wisdom they have gained throughout their lifetime. However, this should not prevent younger individuals from
              trying to lead. Many younger individuals have different views on the world. Bringing in young people as leaders can lead to new and 
              amazing ideas that could have not been discovered if we left older individuals in leadership positions.
        </p>
        <p id="perceptions-paragraph-2">
            Another thing that can determine how people choose to lead is dependent on how they actually view leadership. Some people may think that 
            good leadership can only happen with confident individuals that can speak up. Others may think the opposite and that good leaders do not 
            have to be as confident. However these views can also determine what things people try to improve about themselves to become a better leader. 
            Some people think that improving their skills technical, human, and conceptual can help people become a better leader. Others think that improving 
            your traits can allow you to become a better leader due to how they treat others and how they respond to them. Personally I do not think that 
            there is any specific trait or skill that a person needs to become a better leader. I do believe that anyone can exhibit amazing leadership ability. 
            They just need to adapt based on who they are in order to exhibit that ability.

    <div id="Capacity" name="Capacity">
        <h2 id="capacity-head">Capacity</h2>
        <p>Leadership requires having a decent capacity to lead. However, figuring out that capacity can sometimes be a little bit of a challenge. This 
            requires knowing what a person can bring to the table as a leader. It also involves knowing what resources are available. Good leadership has 
            involved a certain level of risk taking. This allows for new innovations to emerge and possibilities to open up. The way leaders organize themselves 
            as well as their followers is also key to good leadership. This is because having good organization can allow followers to respond better and do things better. 
            These are just a few of the ways leaders can manage their capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good leadership involves leveraging your strengths as well. Combining this with how you would like to be perceived will determine how a person approaches leading. 
            Knowing how an individual should lead based on their strengths can make them more effective as a leader. Every individual will need to figure this out for themselves. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think my strengths as a leader involve me leading by example. I usually behave and know what I should be doing. I may not be very vocal, but I can still lead in 
            other ways. Usually through helping others and getting stuff done.
        </p>

    <div id="ValuesAndEthics" name="Values">
        <h2 id="values-head">Values and Ethics</h2>
        <p>
            There is a difference between being a good leader and having good leadership. Good leaders have the ability to lead their followers well. Good leadership involved 
            doing that, but with a sense of morality. Determining values can allow leaders to determine the goals that they are hoping to achieve. It can also allow leaders to 
            know what lines not to cross personally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding ethics is key as well. Knowing what can potentially be gained and lost from doing certain tasks is very important. This is because leaders can understand 
            what is right and wrong behavior. Leaders should be able to act within those bounds. Leaders should also be able to demonstrate that to their followers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            These things can enable leaders to actually create an impact on the world. If the leaders code of ethics is moral and just this can also make sure that the impact is 
            positive. Creating a positive impact will eventually make be remembered and inspire more leaders. Causing a negative impact will cause a lot of dislike towards the 
            leader. Which is why a leader should not be selfish and look after the needs of others before themself.

    <div id="Takeaways" name="Takeaways">
        <h2 id="takeaways-head">Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            I ended up learning that I should take a deeper look at myself before leading others. Understanding who I am and how I should go about leading others is necessary to 
            understand. I can also take a look at my strengths and weaknesses and see where I can improve. Working with these strengths and weaknesses can make me a better leader 
            to follow. I also need to understand my values. Figuring out what I value will allow me to understand what my goals are and what I am trying to achieve. It will also 
            try to make my leadership goals understood by others and my followers would be willing to help me make a positive impact.
