                We, as humans, have formed many different views of the world. These views usually determine how we behave and react to different situations. 
                These views can also shape the way an individual leads and sees leadership. People tend to trust older individuals to lead more due to the amount 
                of experience and wisdom they have gained throughout their lifetime. However, this should not prevent younger individuals from trying to lead. Many 
                younger individuals have different views of the world. Bringing young people as leaders can lead to new and unique ideas that may not have been discovered 
                if we left older individuals in leadership positions.
            </p>
            <p id="perceptions-paragraph-2">
                Another thing that can determine how people choose to lead is dependent on how they view leadership. Some people may think that good leadership can only 
                happen with confident individuals that can speak up. Others may think the opposite and that good leaders do not have to be as secure. However, these views 
                can also determine what things people try to improve about themselves to become better leaders. Some people think that improving their technical, human, 
                and conceptual skills can help people become better leaders. Others believe that enhancing your traits can allow you to become a better leader due to how 
                they treat others and respond to them. I do not think that there is any specific trait or skill that a person needs to become a better leader. I do believe 
                that anyone can exhibit fantastic leadership ability. They need to adapt based on who they are to demonstrate that ability.

            <p>
                Leadership requires having a decent capacity to lead. However, figuring out that capacity can sometimes be a little bit of a challenge. Knowing your leadership 
                capacity requires knowing what a person can bring to the table as a leader. It also involves knowing what resources are available. Good leadership has involved 
                a certain level of risk-taking. Risk-taking allows for innovations to emerge and possibilities to open up. The way leaders organize themselves as well as their 
                followers are also key to good leadership. This is because having a good organization can allow followers to respond better and do things better. These are just 
                a few of the ways leaders can manage their capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Good leadership involves leveraging your strengths as well. Combining this with how you would like to be perceived will determine how a person approaches leading. 
                Knowing how an individual should lead based on their strengths can make them more effective as a leader. Every individual will need to figure this out for themselves. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I think my strengths as a leader involve me leading by example. I usually behave and know what I should be doing. I may not be very vocal, but I can still lead in other 
                ways, generally through helping others and getting stuff done.

        <div id="ValuesAndEthics" name="Values">
            <h2 id="values-head">Values and Ethics</h2>
            <p>
                There is a difference between being a good leader and having good leadership. Good leaders can lead their followers well. Good leadership involved doing that, but with 
                a sense of morality. Determining values can allow leaders to assess the goals that they are hoping to achieve. It can also enable leaders to know what lines not to cross 
                personally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding ethics is vital as well. Knowing what can potentially be gained and lost from doing specific tasks is very important. This is because leaders can understand 
                what right and wrong behavior is. Leaders should be able to act within those bounds. Leaders should also be able to demonstrate that to their followers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These things can enable leaders actually to create an impact on the world. If the leaders' code of ethics is moral and just, this can also make sure that the effect is 
                positive. Creating a positive impact will eventually be remembered and inspire more leaders. Causing a negative result will cause a lot of dislike towards the leader, 
                which is why a leader should not be selfish and look after others' needs before themself.

            <p>
                I ended up learning that I should take a deeper look at myself before leading others. Understanding who I am and how I should go about leading others is necessary to 
                understand. I can also take a look at my strengths and weaknesses and see where I can improve. Working with these strengths and weaknesses can make me a better leader 
                to follow. I also need to understand my values. Figuring out what I value will allow me to understand my goals and what I am trying to achieve. It will also try to make 
                my leadership goals understood by others, and my followers would be willing to help me make a positive impact.
