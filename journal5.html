            <p id="Innovation-paragraph-1">
                I had a belief before I started taking this class that it would be difficult to make much progress in society without innovation. 
                I also believed that in order to innovate it requires a process and good innovators are always able to be flexible. This class has 
                only confirmed that belief for me. I believe that the best innovators are ones that are creative, flexible, able to work with others, 
                and do not stick to just one solution to a problem. I also believe that innovation does not need to happen with invention even though 
                it often does. Innovation can also happen through the way people lead, processes on how to do things, and general behaviors of people. 
            </p>
            <p id="Innovation-paragraph-2">
                I personally like to think of myself as an innovator. As an engineering major I always need to be open to the possibility that there are 
                different and innovative ways to do things. I also need to be aware that there could be better solutions to problems that I am unaware of. 
                That is why when I work on different teams I try to bring in diverse perspectives to get different takes on a specific problem. One example 
                I like to think of is with the current pandemic. Many people had to innovate in order to reduce risk of getting the virus as well as create 
                the vaccine. Now we are close to getting vaccines widely distributed.

            <p id="Entrepreneurship-paragraph-1">
                My original thoughts on entrepreneurship were that it was all about business. Entrepreneurs were the people who founded or started these 
                various businesses. However, my perspective on this has changed. While entrepreneurs do start up businesses they can also come up with ideas, 
                charities, and other things and follow through on making these things become a reality. Most people think of big tech companies and their CEOâ€™s. 
                However, people do not think of people who are not famous or smaller companies that are not in big tech. In my opinion entrepreneurs are some 
                of the best leaders, because they can lead others to make something possible. 
            </p>
            <p id="Entrepreneurship-paragraph-2">
                I have always thought about starting a business. However, I struggle to come up with something that could be used widely. I also lack the 
                resources necessary to be a decent entrepreneur. I have been trying to expand my network and take opportunities to grow. If I do start a 
                business in the future I will need to expand my network and work with others in a manner better than I do now. I have taken courses in high 
                school and plan on taking more courses at Iowa State about entrepreneurship to help me gain ideas and know how to be an entrepreneur.

            <h2 id="Systems-head">Systems and Sustainability</h2>
            <p id="Systems-paragraph-1">
                The idea of systems thinking is one that I am very familiar with as an engineer. Thinking about things in multiple pieces and how they flow 
                together is something that I do a lot. This often happens when I think about computers and how hardware and software interacts with each other. 
                However, I have also grown to understand that there systems beyond all that. With the way humans interact and also how leaders decide to lead 
                can also be a way to apply systems thinking. Thinking about sustainability is something I was reminded of through this course. Mainly about how 
                to make things last through the future. Many people think about sustainability and the environment. However, people should also think about their 
                businesses and creations so they can last in the future.
            </p>
            <p id="Systems-paragraph-2">
                Making things sustainable is a hard thing for me to try and do. I understand the concept, but executing that just seems difficult to me. I believe 
                it seems difficult to me because this involves planning far into the future, and I like to think about the here and now. There are many ways to 
                start thinking more sustainably like thinking about the future ramifications of something before starting to design a thing. Companies like 
                facebook should have done exercises about thinking of the future before building it. That way they could plan ahead for any negative side effects 
                of the site.

            <p id="takeaways-paragraph-1">
                Throughout the duration of this course and especially the past few weeks I have been inspired to start innovating. Hopefully I can turn one of 
                these innovations into a sustainable business that I could potentially make a profit from. However, regardless of if I can or not, I will continue 
                to try and be creative and innovate to the best of my ability. I will also try to take courses to improve my ability as an entrepreneur. I am 
                fascinated by the idea of creating unique things and helping the community through those things. One day I hope to do that myself and make the 
                world a better place in the process. The leadership skills I learned in this class will also help me make this a reality of mine.
