            My name is Cutler Thayer, and I am currently a student at Iowa State University studying computer engineering. I have a 
            passion for building things, playing games, and learning about random stuff. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this site was to put my journal entries for the class Leadership, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. 
            However, this page is to serve as a reflection of myself as a leader, innovator, and entrepreneur. In the process of 
            reflecting I also plan on going in depth as a leader, innovator, and entrepreneur. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the duration of this class and through other experiences I am aware that what I reflect and think now will 
            probably change in the future. However, this reflection is to serve as a snapshot at this point in time. This reflection 
            was also done as pieces constantly coming back to it once I was able to reflect and put it into words. 
        </p>

    <div id="Reflection" name="Reflection">
        <h2 id="Reflection-head">Reflection Web</h2>
        <img src="./Images/reflection_web.jpg" alt="Web" id="webPic">
        <p>
            One of the first steps I took during this reflection was to draw what I call a “reflection web”. I often draw these to reflect 
            upon different things, brainstorm, or just think through something. My process when drawing this was put something in the center, 
            in this case myself, and put keywords connecting to the center. Then it branches out until I either run out of room or cannot reflect 
            anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this particular web each word represents something I think I am or aspire to be. Each subword either represents something that is 
            an example of how I am that, or what I believe these things are. This particular web tool me about half an hour to complete due to the 
            amount of time I took to reflect upon everything. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially I had come up with five things surrounding my name Leader, Innovator, Entrepreneur, Engineer, and Friend. Then I just began 
            reflecting around each thing bouncing between them as I felt like it. After more reflection on a lot of this, I also believe I am a 
            problem solver and connected myself to that. In addition to me being a leader I also thought of myself as a follower. This is because 
            I believe it is important to sometimes not be a leader in certain situations. Knowing when to step in and out is important.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some key takeaways I learned from doing this were that I believe I can do many things as long as I take action. For example, I am not 
            an entrepreneur, but I believe I can be one through enough action and hard work. Hopefully one day I do. I also like to approach things 
            with kindness and compassion. I believe I am or can be a friend to all. I always listen and will be there as support if I need to be. 
            I know I do not talk that much, but I always try to be a fun and lighthearted person when I do. I also believe that there are many ways 
            to make change regardless of whether it is big or small. Being an engineering student making change physically is something that is very 
            common. However, making a bigger impact is also something that I believe is possible even if it is difficult.
