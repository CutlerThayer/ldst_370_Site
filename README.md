# Leadership, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation Site

This is a site using github pages, HTML, and CSS to present a site for the class Leadership, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation.

This site will be used to accomplish a few things:
* Give a short introduction of myself in relation to this class.
* Present my journal entries for this class in a manner that is not essay based.
* Potentially use as my final project with more development.

This site is a work in progress and feedback is appreciated. 

Feel free to contact me with feedback and suggestions at [cutlerthayer@gmail.com](cutlerthayer@gmail.com). I am open to using new technologies, and improving this site to the best of my ability.
