        The purpose of this site is to write journal entries that relate to the class Leadership, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. This site will contantly be changing throughout the 
        duration of the course because I will contantly be trying to make improvements to it. When I submit my journal entry it will be under the corresponding tab with the matching 
        journal number. Those pages will be untouched once they are submitted. This is to see how the site has changed and improved since its initial creation.
