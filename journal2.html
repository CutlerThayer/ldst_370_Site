                Good leaders should have the ability to think through things and understand their thoughts and how they came. Humans have 
                an incredible capacity to recognize patterns and use those patterns to solve problems. While some issues are simple and can 
                easily be solved through things that have been discovered before, others are more complex and require a certain amount of creativity 
                to solve. Even if they find a way to solve a portion of the problem, it may not solve the whole thing. Leaders must understand that to 
                solve these “wicked problems,” they need to work with others and understand that what they come up with may not be the best or only solution 
                to the problem.
            </p>
            <p id="thinking-paragraph-2">
                I love to solve simple puzzles and problems. Solving these kinds of problems is the kind of thing that makes me happy. It is also at 
                least part of the reason I decided to become an engineering student. This would allow me to gain more skills that would enable me to 
                solve more complex problems better. However, I also need to realize that many problems are not so simple to solve. Many of these require 
                collaboration with others for them to be solved. Some of the other classes I am taking right now are having me solve more complex problems 
                like creating an app or programming a robot. However, eventually, all of these problems will be solved after these classes are over. Some 
                issues require more effort to solve and probably cannot be solved alone, like climate change, war, or racism. While the problem-solving 
                techniques I have learned in the past can be useful, I need to work with others to impact these kinds of problems dramatically.

            <p id="decision-paragraph-1">
                Leaders need to have the ability to make decisions that can impact their followers and beyond. This also requires the ability to think 
                about things from the previous section. However, leaders need to be aware of the benefits and drawbacks of making individual decisions. 
                Making sure that these decisions are the best for everybody is also key to being a good leader. However, many choices can easily be hindered 
                by outside influences like social media, government, other individuals, or emotions. It is possible that these things could help make 
                decisions better, but leaders must be aware of the impact these things are having on their choices.
            </p>
            <p id="decision-paragraph-2">
                Personally, I do not think that there have been many times that the things I mentioned above impact my decision-making. However, I do not 
                really think there would be any way I would know. However, I want to make sure that the decisions I make are truly my own. This is why after 
                the class on this subject matter, I started researching social media's impact on our decision-making. This led to me looking into privacy and 
                how to gain it back, so I can make sure that social media does not impact my decisions. This also may end up being my media artifact, but I 
                am not sure yet.
            </p>
            <p id="decision-paragraph-3">
                I have also seen the impact of other leaders around me and their decisions. This has become very true with the government and the pandemic. 
                Ensuring that I am safe also requires the government to enact policies that make sure I am safe—things like wearing masks, social distancing, 
                and vaccines. While the decisions made by the government are a little strange, the decisions made by my employer have been right. Since I work 
                at a movie theater, it can be hard to maintain these policies, but they have put up several shields and put policies in place to ensure the 
                employees and customers are safe.

            <p id="influence-paragraph-1">
                Leaders must make sure that what they do to influence others is out of a just state of mind. If it is not, it can seem to the follower 
                that the leader is only manipulating them for personal gain. This can be very true of government officials. If they do not act in their 
                people's interest, it can easily cause them to lose their power and position. However, just because a person doesn't have power does not 
                mean that they cannot impact. Leaders do not need to be in a formal position to be influential. They need to have all the traits that make 
                a good leader. 
            </p>
            <p id="influence-paragraph-2">
                Not needing a position of power is something that seems very right to me. This seems to remind me of when I was in boy scouts. Specifically, 
                how people in these positions of power like Senior Patrol Leader and Troop Guide could impact the troop due to their role. However, once they 
                no longer had these positions, they had the same amount of influence they had before. Once they got older and had more experience within the 
                troop, they could lead others without having these positions. This is because the younger scouts were willing to listen to others with more 
                experience and lead more confidently.

            <p id="takeaways-paragraph-1">
                Overall I learned a lot about leadership from this second module. Specifically, leaders should think through things—making sure that leaders 
                are aware of their thoughts and how they are formed—making sure that decisions are their own and not influenced by others. Lastly, making sure 
                that I am making a positive influence instead of trying to achieve some personal gain.
            </p>
            <p id="takeaways-paragraph-2">
                After this module, I will be more aware of my actions and how they impact others. Trying to be mindful of these things is key to making a positive 
                impact and making myself a better leader.
