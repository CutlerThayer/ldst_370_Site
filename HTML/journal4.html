    <div id="Culture" name="Culture">
        <h2 id="culture-head">Culture</h2>
        <p id="culture-paragraph-1">
            Culture is known as the behavior of others while nobody is looking. This is an important thing for leaders to understand due to 
            the fact that every individual's culture can impact the way someone leads. There can also be different cultures inside various 
            groups. Depending on where certain cultures are occurring it can be difficult to form change in those groups. However, 
            regardless of the difficulty it can still be possible for a leader to make change in various groups. The main way that this is 
            possible is by trying to shift the visions and missions of different groups to make the world a better place. However, this should 
            not try to change an individualâ€™s views or beliefs. Everyone is different and should be accepted for who they are. Group cultures 
            that are inviting to everyone enable the world to be a better place.
        </p>
        <p id="culture-paragraph-2">
            I have personally been in several different groups in my life. Groups like the boy scouts, academic clubs, sports teams, and others. 
            Each of these groups provide a unique culture and their own social norms. However, the ones that I have enjoyed the most are the 
            groups where I can have an impact on their culture. One example of this is when I was in boy scouts. I had several opportunities 
            to make an impact through taking on different leadership positions. I also got to make a larger impact on the community on working 
            on a community service project. Things like these are what make a group's culture great in my opinion. All of these things were done 
            while also being completely accepting of others in the process. If we did not have inclusivity in these groups then the things we were 
            trying to accomplish would have much more difficult in the end.

    <div id="Teams" name="Teams">
        <h2 id="teams-head">Teams</h2>
        <p id="teams-paragraph-1">
            Teams are very important for getting things done more effectively and accomplishing greater problems. It is usually very difficult 
            to solve extremely big problems individually. This is why being a part of a team is a wonderful thing. However, making sure that the 
            team is effective and works together requires some leadership from all members. Example of this occurs when a member is slacking or 
            not putting in equal effort. This requires at least one member of the team to keep them on track. It is also useful for everyone to 
            have a common interest in what the team is trying to accomplish. If even one individual is not dedicated to the team then it is not 
            working as effectively as it could be. Another thing that is important is that different teams work differently. This makes sense 
            because each individual of the team is different, so every team would also behave differently. Figuring out what works for each team 
            is ideal for making each team click.

        <p id="teams-paragraph-2">
            Thinking about teams reminds me of the time I was on the robotics team in high school. This was an example of a team that was not as 
            effective as some other teams that I could have been on. While I was very interested in the subject matter and wanted to help the group 
            succeed, others were not as interested but joined because they thought this was the most interesting club they could join. That member 
            eventually quit the next year and started the process of forming a club that more closely aligned to her interests. However, other teams 
            that I have been apart have been more successful. This is due to the fact that unlike in the robotics team everyone was aligned and wanted 
            to accomplish the same thing. Every individual used their strengths to improve the outcome and provide a better end result.
