        <p id="creativity-paragraph-1">
            Leaders have the capability to think creatively and solve many types of problems. They need to be able to think outside the box. 
            In order for leaders to do this well they need to not shut out ideas and be willing to let everything be a possibility. This includes 
            being open to ideas that followers may come up with as well. There are many things that could potentially cause ideas to not be generated, 
            but doing whatever they can to generate as many ideas as possible is key to being a good leader. Applying these creative solutions to a 
            number of different problems is also how leaders should behave.
        </p>
        <p id="creativity-paragraph-2">
            I believe that I am a creative problem solver. That is one of the reasons I enjoy making things and learning new skills. I like to program 
            things and this gives me a different avenue to solve more problems and create new things. I also love to 3D print, paint, and build things 
            as well. I also try not to limit what might be good ideas. However, I am potentially limiting my ideas that can be generated by just going 
            with the first idea that is come up with. If I spent more time generating ideas then I could have even better and more creative solutions.

        <h2 id="success-head">Leading Others to Success</h2>
        <p id="success-paragraph-1">
            Leaders need to be able to understand their followers' needs. Leaders should be there to facilitate what actually has to happen. Followers 
            need to be driven by their leaders to have an impact in what they are involved in regardless if it is a smaller impact or a bigger one. 
            Being more flexible in how things are run and led is also ideal for better leadership. Having followers take the lead on certain parts of 
            projects or lead different portions of a company are good examples of this happening. Listening to followers and adapting to new situations 
            is what can make better leaders.
        </p>
        <p id="success-paragraph-2">
            Personally I struggle to connect with others. That is what may make this particular part of the module hard for me to demonstrate. However, 
            when I do make an attempt to try and meet my followers' needs I try to understand what things are truly needed. These can be like materials, 
            support, change in scheduling or structure. I am open to receiving new ideas, and I will do my best to make sure that all of the needs of my 
            followers are met. I also realize when other people's strengths are better than mine in specific situations. This is when I will try to let 
            others take the lead in groups I join. However, I will never pressure them to do it unless they are up for the task.

    <div id="Change" name="Change">
        <h2 id="Change-head">Change-Processes</h2>
        <p id="change-paragraph-1">
            Being proactive and accepting change is another key to being a good leader. Reacting to change appropriately is what leaders should try to do. 
            In fact taking change as an opportunity to grow as a leader is what people should try to do as well. Another thing that I learned is that leaders 
            should try to succeed, but when they do fail they need to take it as an opportunity to grow and change. Failure is inevitable, but leaders should 
            be flexible and learn from the failure. If leaders do not learn from the failure then they are not being as great a leader as they could possibly 
            be.
        </p>
        <p id="change-paragraph-2">
            I believe I am open to change, but that is hard for me to really evaluate on my own. Some little things that have changed in my life are things 
            like the games I play and shows I watch. However, I have also been aware that my leadership style has slowly begun to change. I used to lead by 
            example and do what should be done and guide people through various tasks. Now I have slowly tried to gain more confidence by setting up times 
            to meet with teammates and set goals as being a more direct leader. I do believe that I can be more open to change. I need to be open to trying 
            more new activities and be willing to take more risks. I have failed a lot, but only in things that I am used to doing. Trying new activities and 
            failing at them will give me more chances to grow.

    <div id="Takeaways" name="Takeaways">
        <h2 id="takeaways-head">Takeaways</h2>
        <p id="takeaways-paragraph-1">
            Overall I think I have learned a lot about helping others succeed. Being creative and solving unique problems is one way to help others. If a 
            leader can help solve these kinds of problems then this can lead to the success of others. Another thing that I learned from this module is how 
            to understand the needs of followers. Since this has been one of the tougher things for me to do, getting a better grasp on this will definitely 
            make me a better leader. Lastly, I learned about change and failure. This is important to leadership because leaders need to be accepting of change. 
            Leaders also need to learn from their failures. Not doing either of these things will cause leaders to lose valuable opportunities. I learned a wide 
            array of things from this module that I can try to apply to my own leadership practice.
